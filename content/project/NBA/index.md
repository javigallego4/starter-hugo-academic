The **Most Valuable Player (MVP)** award is  one of the most prestigious accolades that an NBA player can receive in  his career. <!--more-->

At the end of each regular season, the MVP  award is presented to a single player that is deemed worthy of this  title.

However, through all over the media, there are still many questions and debates  regarding the definition of most valuable player. *Is it a player that achieves an outstanding individual statistical success? Is  it the best player on the greatest team of the regular season? or is it  all about narratives/story lines that numbers cannot possibly define?*

While there may not be a definite answer to this discussion, tools such as **machine learning models** along with **relevant statistical data** can be utilized to find some patterns and insight into the logic of NBA MVP selection.
