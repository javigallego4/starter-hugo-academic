For the [March edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground Series](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-mar-2022/overview) you're challenged to forecast twelve-hours of traffic flow in a U.S. metropolis. The time series in this dataset are labelled with both location coordinates and a direction of travel -- a combination of features that will test your skill at spatio-temporal forecasting within a highly dynamic traffic network.

Which model will prevail? The venerable linear regression? The  deservedly-popular ensemble of decision trees? Or maybe a cutting-edge  graph neural-network? We can't wait to see!
